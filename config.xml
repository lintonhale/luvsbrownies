    	I know what I want to buy. I compare prices. I stretch dollars.  Here's how it works:  I track the best prices I find, just for the items I buy all the time.  If I want to compare prices, I can input size and unit of measure and see the price per unit. For example, to know the value of a small bottle of juice as compared to a large one, I input the size and price of each bottle.  If the 12 oz bottle is priced at $2.40, and the gallon is $6.40, I will see that the 12 oz bottle costs $.20/per oz, while the gallon is only $.10/per oz.  If the people in my life drink a lot of orange juice, I stretch dollars by buying gallons.  That said, if the big bottle would just sit on the shelf after the first time it is opened, I might stretch my dollars further by buying the serving-size smaller bottle.  I know what I want to buy and I compare prices.  I stretch dollars.

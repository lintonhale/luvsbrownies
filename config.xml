    <name>i Stretch $</name>

    <description>
        i track where i get the best price for the items i buy regularly.<br><br>
        
        to compare price i can input size and unit of measure for an item to see the price per unit.  for example, to understand the value of a small bottle as compared large bottle of juice, i can input a row for the 12 oz bottle priced at $2.40 and another row for the gal at $6.40.  i can then see that the 12 oz bottle costs $.20/per oz, while the gallon is only $.10/per oz.  if i drink a lot of orange juice, buying gallons will really stretch my dollars!<br><br>
        
        i choose.  i compare.  i stretch dollars.

                <strong>I know what I want to buy. I compare and I choose. I stretch dollars.</strong><br>
                I track the best prices I find for the items I buy regularly.  If I want help to compare prices, I input size and unit of measure for an item to see the price per unit.  To understand the value of a small bottle as compared to a large bottle of juice, I can input the size and price of each, and then see and compare the price per ounce.  For example, the 12 oz bottle is priced at $2.40, and the gallon is $6.40.  I see that the 12 oz bottle costs $.20/per oz, while the gallon is only $.10/per oz.  If my people drink a lot of orange juice, buying gallons will really stretch my dollars!
